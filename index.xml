As these processes involve sync and async communication, this document specifies professional standards all participants of SIGTURK and SIGTURK-related dialogue agree to uphold to promote formal reliability of SIGTURK outputs, respect, competence, responsibility, and integrity while recognizing the rapidly changing society and the necessity to exercise more considerable caution in this spirit by every participant.</description></item><item><title>Constitution</title><link>https://sigturk.com/constitution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sigturk.com/constitution/</guid><description>PDF version
I. TURKIC LANGUAGES Turkic language family includes approximately half a billion speakers around the world
Specially focused around the geographical range across the Eurasian continent
The status of recognition and formalization of the languages may range from national status to critically endangered
From the scientific perspective, the Turkic languages form a unique working ground, marked by a striking structural similarity, as well as an easily recognizable shared core vocabulary and inflectional inventory, which span the entire group of languages.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://sigturk.com/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sigturk.com/contact/</guid><description>For more information, please contact us.</description></item><item><title>Docs</title><link>https://sigturk.com/docs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sigturk.com/docs/</guid><description/></item><item><title>People</title><link>https://sigturk.com/people/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sigturk.com/people/</guid><description>Executive Committee President Duygu Ataman (email) (GitHub)

For more details, please visit the project GitHub page: https://github.com/turkic-interlingua/til-mt
Ongoing Projects We are currently establishing standards and methodology for building a large-scale multilingual Turkic Corpus that would have linguistic annotations to be used for developing and evaluating systems for solving natural language processing tasks, such as past-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, text summarization, and question answering.</description></item><item><title>Register</title><link>https://sigturk.com/register/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sigturk.com/register/</guid><description>To start joining membership, you should fill out the form.

Our main objective is to bring together an interdisciplinary community of researchers working on different aspects of natural language processing (NLP) models and corpora in Turkic languages, providing the recently growing number of researchers working on the topic with a means of communication and an opportunity to present their work and exchange ideas.</description></item></channel></rss>
