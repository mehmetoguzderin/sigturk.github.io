Dear Members of the SIG, 

I hope this email finds you well. As you may know, our constitution 
outlines the structure and function of our organization. We believe that 
it is important to periodically review and update our constitution to 
reflect changes in our membership and evolving needs. 

Currently, our constitution states: 

> The elected officers of the SIG shall consist of a President, a Secretary 
> and up to 4 other officers, constituting the Executive Committee. The 
> President and Secretary shall be members in good standing of the ACL. 

We are proposing a minor amendment to this paragraph to allow for up to 
5 other officers on the Executive Committee. The proposed amended 
paragraph is as follows: 

> The elected officers of the SIG shall consist of a President, a Secretary 
> and up to 5 other officers, constituting the Executive Committee. The 
> President and Secretary shall be members in good standing of the ACL. 

We believe that this amendment will allow for more diverse perspectives 
on the Executive Committee and improve our ability to achieve our goals 
as an organization.
