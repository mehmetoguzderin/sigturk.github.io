= The First Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Turkic Languages (SIGTURK) August 15-16 2024, Bangkok (Co-located with ACL)

== Introduction

We present the first edition of the SIGTURK Workshop representing the annual
meeting of the ACL Special Interest Group on Turkic Languages, which aims to
provide a new venue that will promote studies on computational linguistics in
Turkic languages. Our main objective is to bring together an interdisciplinary
community of researchers working on different aspects of natural language
processing (NLP) models and corpora in Turkic languages, providing the recently
growing number of researchers working on the topic with a means of
communication and an opportunity to present their work and exchange ideas.

The main objectives of the workshop are:

* To construct and present a wide array of methodology and know-how, including foundational work for formulation and analysis of NLP models suitable for Turkic language processing.
* To provide a better understanding on how Turkic language typology may impact the applicability of current methods and motivate the development of novel methods that are more generic or competitive in Turkic languages
* Preparation of new corpora and resources in under-studied Turkic languages
* To build infrastructure by means of software libraries and benchmarks for developing NLP models that would accelerate progress in the field
* Promote collaborations across scientists from across the world that have specific interests in the study of computational linguistics in Turkic languages.

By supporting collaborations across research groups working on machine
learning, Turkic linguistics, and real-life applications of NLP tasks in
various languages, the ultimate goal of the workshop is to enlarge connections
across our community and allow rapid development of NLP methods and tools that
are applicable to a wide range of Turkic languages.

== Topics of interest

We welcome submissions on, but not limited to, the following topics:

* Computational linguistics: models of all aspects of linguistics in Turkic languages (e.g., semantics, syntax, lexicon, morphology)
* Systems: Case studies on the construction of NLP systems for Turkic languages
* Evaluation: Understanding the applicability of current NLP methods in Turkic languages
* Metrics: New metrics and measures for evaluating NLP systems suitable to Turkic languages
* Learning from sparse data: Novel methods for learning from small or sparse data in Turkic languages
* Resources: Datasets, benchmarks, and software libraries for NLP models in Turkic languages

== "Hack Together" programming event

In addition to the workshop itself, the second day will be devoted to a full-day collaborative programming event "Hack Together".
Our goal is to demonstrate the SIGTURK NLP library and interested parties can contribute to the integration of new NLP methods and models into the SIGTURK pipeline.
The SIGTURK infrastructure can be found at https://github.com/sigturk.
Findings of the event will be combined into a system demonstration paper.

== Submission guidelines

=== Research papers

We invite all potential participants to submit their novel research contributions in the related fields as long papers following the ACL 2024 long paper format (anonymized with 8 pages excluding the references, and an additional page for the camera-ready versions for the accepted papers). All accepted research papers will be published as part of our workshop proceedings and will be presented either through oral presentations or poster sessions.
Our research paper track will accept submissions through our own submission system available at https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2024/Workshop/SIGTURK.

=== Extended abstracts

Besides long paper submissions, we also invite previously published or ongoing and incomplete research contributions to our non-archival extended abstract track. All extended abstracts can use the same EMNLP template with a 2-page limit, excluding the bibliography. Extended abstracts can be submitted to the workshop submission system using the link: https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2024/Workshop/SIGTURK.

== Awards

A best paper award will be presented at the workshop and will be announced on our website.

== Diversity and inclusion statement

We are committed to promoting diversity and inclusion within our community.

== Workshop format

The workshop will be conducted in a hybrid format, with both an in-person component and virtual participation options.

== Venue

The workshop will be held in Bangkok, Thailand. Future details TBA.

== Registration

Details regarding registration will be available on our website closer to the event.
